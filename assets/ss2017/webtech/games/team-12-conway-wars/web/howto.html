            <h1>How to play ConwayWars</h1>
            <h2>Game of Life</h2>
            <p>
                The game ConwayWars is based on Game of Life, designed by John Horton Conway in 1970.<br>
                This game consists of a x times y grid, containing cells, that are awoken or die depending on their
                neighbours.
                There are four rules for the cells state after each iteration.
            </p>
            <h3>Rules</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Any alive cell with fewer than two alive neighbours dies of underpopulation</li>
                <li>Any alive cell with two or three alive neighbours keeps living</li>
                <li>Any alive cell with more than tree alive neighbours dies of overpopulation</li>
                <li>Any dead cell with exactly three alive neighbours is awoken in the next generation</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="example">
                <label for="empl1">Underpopulation</label>
                <img id="empl1" src="images/example1.gif" alt="Example Underpopulation" height="200" width="200">
            </div>
            <div class="example">
                <label for="empl2">Staying Alive</label>
                <img id="empl2" src="images/example2.gif" alt="Example Stay Alife" height="200" width="200">
            </div>
            <div class="example">
                <label for="empl3">Overpopulation</label>
                <img id="empl3" src="images/example3.gif" alt="Example Overpopulation" height="200" width="200">
            </div>
            <div class="example">
                <label for="empl4">Awoken</label>
                <img id="empl4" src="images/example4.gif" alt="Example Awoken" height="200" width="200">
            </div>

            <h2>Making it a game</h2>
            <p>
                To make this an interesting game one defines that each cell belongs to a player and, lets the players
                interact with the lifecycle to influence the next generation and make one's cells dominate the grid.<br>
                The cell's player is indicated by the cell's colour. Each time a new cell is awoken it's player depends
                on witch players their neighbours belong to. A new cell always has 3 neighbours so under normal
                circumstances
                it should always be defined.
            </p>
            <h2>Interaction</h2>
            <p>
                There are two basic types for a player to interact with the game. Each player has his own turn one after
                another and each turn triggers a new generation of the cell population. For these interactions each
                player has to invest points. By default each player gets one point at the beginning of his turn.
            </p>
            <h3>Kill</h3>
            <p>
                A player can invest one point to kill a cell. Sometimes it can even be worth it to kill one own's cell.
            </p>
            <h3>Awake</h3>
            <p>
                A player can invest two points to awake a cell. For that it's necessary to save points in the first
                place.
            </p>
            <h3>Skip</h3>
            <p>
                A player can skip his turn to save points, if he has absolutely no idea what to do or to give his opponent
                a fair chance.
            </p>
            <p>
                To kill a cell simply click or tap on a living cell. To awake a cell click or tap on a dead cell and
                to skip click ot tap onto the skip button.
            </p>
            <h2>End Of Game</h2>
            <p>
                As soon as a player has lost all of his cells he is removed from the game. The last player that still has
                cells wins and the game ends. If all remaining players lose their cells in the same turn it is a considered a
                draw.
            </p>
            <h2>Preview</h2>
            <p>
                To make it easier for players to see what will happen in the next generation, each cell shows a preview. The inner part
                of the cell shows the cells state in the next generation. Black means that it will die.
            </p>
            <h2>Cell Life and Weight</h2>
            <p>
                To make the game even more complex, cells can have multiple lives an weight. By default these are
                one.<br>
                A cell with more than one life can survive an evolution even if it would die and loses one life instead.
                If it reaches zero lives it finally dies.<br>
                To kill a cell with several lives a Player also needs more than one action, reducing the cells lives to
                zero.<br>
                On the other hand a cell whose weight is bigger than one counts as more cells when calculating if a
                neighbour
                dies, stays alive or is awoken. so a cell could be awoken by a single cell with weight equal to 3.
            </p>
            <h2>Powerups</h2>
            <p>
                For advanced interaction with the game, players can use powerups to solve difficult levels.
                These powerups differ in types and can have additional attributes.
            </p>
            <h3>Powerup Kill</h3>
            <div class="powericons">
                <div class="powericon">
                    <img id="pow1" src="images/powerupButton_kill.png" alt="powerup button kill" height="100"
                         width="100"></div>
                <div class="powericon">
                    <img id="pow2" src="images/powerupButton_kill_range.png" alt="powerup button kill range"
                         height="100"
                         width="100">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                The Kill powerup acts like a normal Kill action, but has a range and a force.
                If this powerup comes with a range, it does not only kill the cell selected, but also the surrounding
                cells
                within the range.<br>
                The force defines the amount of lives a cell loses if the player tries to kill it.
            </p>
            <h3>Powerup Awake</h3>
            <div class="powericons">
                <div class="powericon">
                    <img id="pow5" src="images/powerupButton_wakeup_1.png" alt="powerup button awake" height="100"
                         width="100"></div>
                <div class="powericon">
                    <img id="pow3" src="images/powerupButton_3life.png" alt="powerup button 3 life" height="100"
                         width="100"></div>
                <div class="powericon">
                    <img id="pow4" src="images/powerupButton_weight.png" alt="powerup button weight" height="100"
                         width="100">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                The Awake powerup also acts like a normal awake action, but gives the new cell more lives and/or weight.
            </p>
            <h3>Powerup Repeat</h3>
            <div class="powericons">
                <div class="powericon">
                    <img id="pow6" src="images/powerupButton_repeat.png" alt="powerup repeat" height="100"
                         width="100">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                The Repeat powerup gives the player a second turn.
            </p>
            <h3>Powerup +1 Point</h3>
            <div class="powericons">
                <div class="powericon">
                    <img id="pow7" src="images/powerupButton_plusone.png" alt="powerup plus one" height="100"
                         width="100">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                The +1 point powerup gives the player +1 Point. Who would have thought that?
            </p>
            <h3>Powerup Ugly Goo</h3>
            <div class="powericons">
                <div class="powericon">
                    <img id="pow8" src="images/powerupButton_goo.png" alt="powerup ugly goo" height="100"
                         width="100">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                This powerup spawns a new kind of cell that dominates Player and Ai Cells and slowly takes more and more
                space if you don't pay attention.
            </p>
